# ELECTION ANALYSIS
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of the Indian Election 2024 using Tableau. The data for this analysis was sourced by web scraping the official election results website(https://results.eci.gov.in/), using Python's BeautifulSoup module. The visualization and insights derived from this data provide a comprehensive overview of the election outcomes.
